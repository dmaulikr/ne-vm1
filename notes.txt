limits:
	-VM resolution: 320 * y (16/9)
	-real resolution: 320*3 * 180*3
	-colors: monochromatic (green)
	-just one or two c++ class (splitted info few files for better orientation)
	-naive "asm" interpret (no machine code, no compilation)
	-simulated TXT mode
	-256 sprites (8 x 8) - including character set (font)
	-VM memory byte/word: 32 bits (signed)
	-VM event list entry: 16 bits (unsigned)
	-two chars long instructions (e.g. mo for mov)
	-[?] what about virtual machine used in game?
		-I will try two VM now
			If there will not be problems now I will use it in game
	-editor not available in full game (to save time)
	-GL_QUADS only
	-immediate mode only (no vertex buffers)
	-no allocators
	-no random number support (next time)
	

VM memory:
	0-1023 - registers and real machine registers (mapped)
	1024 - sprites addr
	32768 - text mode - page 0 (front/back buffer)
	33768 - text mode - page 1 (front/back buffer)
	
	
VM1 specification:
	memory:
	  0-32767 (system memory - undocumented parts are reserved for future)
	  32768-65535 - user memory
	
	
registers:
	GFX_EDIT_ADDR
	GFX_SPRITES_ADDR
	GFX_SPRITE_W
	GFX_FRONTBUFFER_ADDR	;it is some kind of text mode
	GFX_BACKBUFFER_ADDR
	SVM_RENDER_ENABLED
	...

	[x] $some text here ;string data marker
	
	
op1:
	[x] [number] ;number can't be 0 here (0 is like NULL)
	[x] [[number]]
	[x] [[[number]]] should be also possibleÉ
op2:
	[x] number 
	[x] -number
	[x] [number] ;number can't be 0 here (0 is like NULL)
	[x] [[number]]
	[x] [[[number]]] should be also possible... ;)
